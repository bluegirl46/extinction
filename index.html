       <h1><center>The Crisis of Animal Extinction </center></h1>
       <p>Our planet is now in the midst of its sixth mass extinction of animals.This would be the sixth wave of extinctions in the past billion years. We're currently experiencing the worst rate of species dying-off since the loss of the dinosaurs 65 million years ago. Although extinction is a natural phenomenon, it occurs at a natural "background" rate of about one to five species per year. Scientists currently estimated we're now losing species at up to 1,000 times the background rate, with literally dozens going extinct every day. It could be a scary future, with as many as 30 to 50 percent of all species possibly heading toward extinction by mid-century.</p>

       <p>In the past, mass extinctions, have been caused by events like asteroid strikes, volcanic eruptions, and natural climate shifts, the current crisis is almost entirely caused by us- humans. In fact, 99 percent of threatened species are currently at risk from human activities, primarily those driving habitat loss, hunting, and cutting down forests. The most important one is global warming. The rate of change in our biosphere is increasing, and because every species' extinction potentially leads to the extinction of others bound to them in a ecological web, numbers of extinctions are likely to fall in the coming decades as the ecosystems continues to unravel.</p> 
       <p>Animal species' diversity ensures ecosystem resilience. Conservationists often focus their efforts on species-rich ecosystems like rainforests and coral reefs- which have a lot to lose- a comprehensive strategy for saving biodiversity. Habitats with fewer species also have a lot to lose, like grasslands, tundra, and polar seas â€” for which any loss could be irreversibly devastating. And while much concerns over extinction focuses on lost species, most of the biodiversity's benefits take place at a local level, and conserving local populations is the only way to ensure genetic diversity is critical for a species' long-term survival.</p>
       <p>In the past 500 years, we know of approximately 1,000 species that have gone extinct- but this doesn't account for thousands of species that disappeared before scientists had a chance to describe them. Nobody really knows exactly how many species are currently in danger of becoming extinct but conservation scientist estimates that there are 14,000 to 35,000 endangered species in the United States, which is 7% to 18% of U.S. Roughly 16,928 species worldwide are being threatened with extinction, and roughly 38% of them assessed.</p>
