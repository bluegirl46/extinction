     <h2><center><img src="images/scarlet.JPG" width="400">Birds occur in nearly every habitat on the planet and are often the most visible and familiar wildlife to people across the globe. As such, they provide an important bellwether for tracking changes to the biosphere. Declining bird populations across most to all habitats confirm that profound changes are occurring on our planet in response to human activities. 
     In 2009, a report on the state of birds in the United States found that 31% of the 800 species in the country are of conservation concern. Globally, "Birdlife International" estimates that 12% of known 9,865 bird species around the globe are now considered threatened, with 192 species or 2% facing an "extremely high risk" of extinction in the wild. Habitat loss and degradation have caused most of the bird declines, but the most common impacts are from invasive species, and being captured by collectors too.
