     <h2><center><img src="images/Reptiles.JPG" width="400">Globally, 21% of the total evaluated reptiles in the world are deemed endangered or vulnerable to extinction, thats a total of 594 species. while in the United States, 32 reptile species are at risk, that's 9% of them total. On islands reptile species have been dealt the hardest blow, with at least 28 island reptiles having died out since the 1600s. Scientists say that the island-style extinctions are creeping onto the main lands because human activities fragment continental habitats, creating "virtual islands" as they isolate species from one another. This prevents interbreeding and hindering the populations' health. The main threats to reptiles are habitat destruction and the invasion of non-native species, which prey on reptiles and compete with them for habitat and food.
