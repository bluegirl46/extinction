     <h2><center><img src="images/mammals.JPG" width="400">One of the most striking elements of the present extinction crisis is the fact that the majority of our closest relatives- the mammals are severely endangered. About 90% of primates- the group that contains mammals such as monkeys, lemurs, lorids, galagos, tarsiers, and apes (humans)- live in tropical forests, which are disappearing fast. The estimate is that almost 50% of the world's primate species are at risk of extinction. Overall, half the globe's 5,491 known mammals are declining in population, and a fifth are clearly at risk of disappearing forever with no less than 1,131 mammals across the globe classified as endangered, threatened, or vulnerable. In addition to this, marine mammals- including several species such as whales, dolphins, and porpoises- are among those mammals slipping most quickly toward extinction.
