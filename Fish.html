     <h2><center><img src="images/fish.JPG" width="400">The increasing demand for water, the damming of rivers throughout the world, the dumping of various pollutants, and invasive species make aquatic ecosystems some of the most threatened on the planet. It's not surprising that there are many fish species endangered in both freshwater and marine habitats. 
     The American Fisheries Society identified 700 species of freshwater or anadromous fish in North America as being imperiled, amounting to 39% of all fish on the continent. In North American marine waters, there are at least 82 fish species imperiled, and across the globe, 1,851 species of fish. That would be 21% of all fish species that were evaluated and deemed at risk of extinction, including more than a third of sharks and rays.
